# A case study about article replication

This repository contains a Python notebook replicating the
F. M. Ametrano and M. Bianchetti paper _Everything You Always Wanted
to Know About Multiple Interest Rate Curve Bootstrapping but Were
Afraid to Ask_, [available on
SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2219548).

It is meant to highlight issues such as providing the code for an
article in the first place, as well as others that might seem
secondary but are just as needed for replication; such as pinning the
versions of the code dependencies, or using a permanent identifier
such as a DOI to pin the version of the code itself.

Eventually, this repository will have a companion article explaining
the process.
